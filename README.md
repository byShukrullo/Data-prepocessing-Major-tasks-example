# Data-prepocessing-Major-tasks-example

This repository demonstrates common data preprocessing techniques using healthcare-related datasets. It covers the essential steps for preparing raw health data for analysis and machine learning.

## 📋 Overview of Preprocessing Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handles missing values
- Replaces invalid entries (e.g., 'error')

### 2. Data Integration
- Merges patient data from multiple sources

### 3. Data Transformation
- Normalizes glucose values
- Encodes diagnosis labels using label encoding

### 4. Data Reduction
- Selects essential features for analysis

### 5. Data Discretization
- Categorizes age and glucose levels into meaningful bins

### 6. Data Binning
- Groups BMI into categories such as Underweight, Normal, and Overweight
